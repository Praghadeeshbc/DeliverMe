<h2>About the project</h2>
  <h3>Problem</h3>
  <ul>
  <li>This kind of situation occurs very often where we meet the person from our same area at a shop.</li>
  <li>Hence there are chances that a person whom you may not be knowing (but from the same locality )and yourself visit the same shop.</li>
  <li>If we could detect and control this, we can also control traffic and gatherings like this.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Our Solution</h3>
  <ul>
  <li>Our application has two users namely, the one who seeks for help and the helper.</li>
   <li>The helper updates in our application that he will visit a shop and the person who needs help will check our application that shows the list of people          who are going to visit the same shop.</li>
  <li>He can request the helper and if the helper accepts the request, the help seeker has to give some money as reward for his help.</li>
  <li>Hence, our application solves this by establishing contact  between the persons who lives in a same locality and thereby reducing crowd and traffic.</li>
